A newspaper report on January 1, 2008 that Iran hanged two convicted drug traffickers in the southeastern city of Zahedan.
This brings the number of executions for 2007 to at least 297.
The hardline Kayhan newspaper said the men were identified as Mehdi Rigi Javan and Naser hedieh sasooli and were hanged in prison on December 31, 2007 for trafficking 59 kilos (130 pounds) of heroin.
An AFP count compiled from local press reports stated that the executions brought the number of people hanged in Iran in 2007 to at least 297.
This figure well exceeds the 177 convicted criminals executed in 2006 According to Amnesty International.
Iran is currently the leader in death penalty executions after China.
The number of executions increased in Iran last year amid a campaign that is aimed at improving security in society.
The campaign has been aimed at arresting drug-traffickers, rapists and those deemed a social menace.
Dozens of such criminals have been hanged in public.
Several executions have occurred in major cities.
Capital offences in Iran include murder, rape, armed robbery, serious drug trafficking and adultery.
Rights groups have accused Iran of employing the death penalty excessively.
Authorities say capital punishment is an effective deterrent that is only used after an exhaustive judicial process.

Officials stated that on 080204 India and Pakistan signed an accord to exchange security information.
This Accord opened up a new channel of communication between India and Pakistan.
India and Pakistan are nuclear-armed rivals.
The accord makes conditions possible for regular contacts between India's military-funded Institute of Defence Studies and analysis and Pakistan's state-run Institute for Strategic Studies.
The accord stipulates that the Institute of Defence Studies and analysis and Pakistan's state-run Institute for Strategic Studies will send experts to participate in state-sponsored workshops in India and Pakistan and later engage in joint military research projects.
The Institute of Defence Studies and analysis and the Institute for Strategic Studies are 2 mutually-suspicious think tanks.
Shireen Mazari stated at the accord signing ceremony in New Delhi that the purpose of the accord is to build channels of communication at the level of scholars and that exchanges of security studies had been limited in the past because of the strained ties between India and Pakistan.
Shireen Mazari is the director of Pakistan's Institute for Strategic Studies.
Narendra sisodia stated that the accord was a landmark because India and Pakistan have never had open discussions on security issues with the exception of contacts at international forums.
Narendra sisodia is the Head of India's Institute of Defense studies and analysis and a former Indian Defence Secretary.
Narendra sisodia stated with caution that the 080204 accord between the Institute of Defence Studies and analysis and the Institute for Strategic Studies would not replace any official dialogue.
India and Pakistan are South Asian rivals who have fought 3 wars since India and Pakistan's independence from British rule in 470000.
India and Pakistan set in motion a slow-moving peace process in 040000 only 5 years after they came dangerously close to a fourth conflict.
The 040000 peace process dialogue has led to closer Indian and Pakistani political contacts and greater transport links.
The armies of India and Pakistan have avoided direct contacts except for annual discussions on unresolved disputes.
